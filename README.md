"Comprehensive Network and Server Upgrade for Win Financial Group (WFG): Enabling Scalable Growth and Optimal IT Performance"

This project was completed as a part of IS 6640-001 Networking and Servers course at University of Utah. 

As a key member of an IT consulting group, I mimicked a successful bid for a network/server upgrade project for Win Financial Group (WFG), a dynamic startup with plans to grow from 30 to 200 employees within the next year. WFG had recently secured funding to invest in their IT infrastructure, and our task was to propose a comprehensive solution that met their current needs and facilitated future expansion. The Request for Proposal (RFP) outlined specific requirements for wired and wireless networks, core network, local and cloud-based servers, and associated services.
